[Optimizing Fashion Retail Inventory Management With Deep Learning Content-based Image Retrieval](http://tobeupdated) is the accompanying blog about this repository. 

This is an experiment in attempt to address the following challenges that large online retailers may face:

•	Highlight and remove duplicate apparel items from the catalogue of millions of professionally photographed items.  The aim is to ‘clean up’ the existing catalogue. 

•	Retrieve image of studio quality with white background from catalogue, using the input of a lower quality mobile phone photo and with a busy background. The aim is to reduce the chances of duplicate entry in the future.
